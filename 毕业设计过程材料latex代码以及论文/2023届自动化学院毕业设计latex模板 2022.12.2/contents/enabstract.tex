This paper introduces the development history and current status of image search engines.And introduces a design method for an image search engine based on Python. This search engine can automatically retrieve and return similar images by inputting them.
Specifically, the project used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract image features and used Euclidean similarity algorithms to calculate the similarity between images. This paper also introduces how to use the Flask framework and HTML technology to implement a basic web interface, allowing users to easily upload and search for images. Finally, this paper tested and evaluated the search engine, and discussed possible improvement directions. This Python based image search engine has broad application prospects, such as e-commerce, medical imaging, agricultural analysis, and other fields.
